# Sentiment Analysis of SXSW 2011 Tweets - README

## Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets from the SXSW 2011 conference to analyze customer opinions about technology brands and products. The goal is to help businesses understand customer perception, prioritize product improvements, and measure satisfaction by automatically classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Business Problem
Businesses struggle to:

* Determine customer sentiment from unstructured social media data.

* Prioritize product improvements based on customer feedback.

* Predict customer churn and measure satisfaction.

* Identify what customers value vs. what needs improvement.

## Solution
A machine learning pipeline that:

* Processes and cleans tweet data.

* Classifies sentiment using multiple ML algorithms.

* Analyzes brand-specific sentiment patterns.

* Provides actionable business insights for product development.

## Dataset
* Source: SXSW 2011 conference tweets.

* Size: 9,093 tweets after cleaning.

* Features:

1. tweet_text: Original tweet content.

2. emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at: Brand/product mentioned.

3. is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product: Sentiment label.

* Sentiment Distribution (original):

Positive: 33%

Neutral: 60%

Negative: 7%

### Key Challenges & Solutions
#### 1. Class Imbalance

![Distribution of sentiment lables (%)](https://github.com/Joan-omanyo/dsc-phase-4-project-v3-group-6/blob/main/images/Distribution%20of%20sentiment%20lables.png)

Problem: Severe imbalance (Neutral: 60%, Negative: 7%)

Solution: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) to balance all classes to 5,388 instances each

#### 2. Text Preprocessing

Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.

Applied lemmatization and stopword removal.

Used TF-IDF with n-grams (unigrams + bigrams).

#### 3. Feature Selection

Used Chi-squared test for feature selection.

Optimal: 2,000 features provided best F1-score (0.6444).

##### Model Performance

Model Rankings (Accuracy)

* Random Forest: 69.1% (F1: 66.8%)

* Voting Classifier: 65.5% (F1: 64.5%)

* SVM: 64.6% (F1: 60.5%)

* Logistic Regression: 64.1% (F1: 61.8%)

* Multinomial NB: 63.2% (F1: 62.6%)

* Baseline (Naive Bayes): 64.8% (F1: 64.8%)

###### Best Model

Algorithm: Random Forest

Accuracy: 69.1%

Improvement over baseline: 6.5%
