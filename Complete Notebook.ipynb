    "The business cannot effectively determine whether customer opinions about the product are positive, negative, or neutral. This makes it difficult to prioritize improvements, predict churn, or measure customer satisfaction. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis on product comments to uncover customer perception and guide product development.\n",

This will provide clear negative feedback that can be used as improvement points for product managers, as well as positive feedback that highlights what customers value and may want added as product features. Overall, this creates a clear improvement plan for the product.\n"
